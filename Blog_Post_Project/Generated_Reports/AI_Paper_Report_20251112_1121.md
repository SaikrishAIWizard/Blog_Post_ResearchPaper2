It looks like the **methodology section** got a bit *short*—think of it as a *digital paper airplane* that only has a single wing: the word **“safe.”** 🛩️

> Without the rest of the story (datasets, models, training loops, hyper‑parameter tuning), we’re basically trying to explain a recipe with only the word **“bake”** in it. 🍰

Because of that, I can’t dive into the nitty‑gritty of your research pipeline—no “how‑we‑cleaned‑the‑data” or “why‑the‑model‑regressed” to brag about.

🔵 It’s like trying to build a rocket with just a *“Launch”* button and no instructions. 🚀

🟣 If you’re up for it, share the full methodology or a more detailed outline, and I’ll spin it into a clear, engaging narrative—complete with a dash of *science‑comic* flair.  

🧩 Until then, I’ll keep my detective hat on and wait for the missing pieces of your experimental jigsaw puzzle.

💬 *Ever tried explaining your breakthrough with half the story missing?*  
🤔 Drop a line—what part of your methodology always feels like the hardest piece to fit?
