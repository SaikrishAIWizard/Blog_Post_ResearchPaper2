I’m afraid the snippet you shared only contains the word “safe” and a placeholder heading—no actual methodology to work with.

💭 To turn it into a lively, story-driven explanation (and sprinkle in a few chuckles along the way), I’ll need the full details:

• the models  
• data pipeline  
• training tricks  
• any architectural quirks the paper describes

🚀 Could you paste the complete methodology section (or a concise summary of its key components) into a new message?

Once I have that, I’ll craft a humor-infused narrative that keeps the science spot-on while making it feel like a friendly science documentary.

💬 **Your turn:** drop the details and let’s bring this paper to life — together.
