It looks like the “safe” methodology section is playing a game of *invisible ink* — no actual steps, models, or data were pasted in. 😕  

To spin a proper, humor-filled narrative, I’ll need the juicy details:  
• the **datasets** you sampled  
• the **algorithms** you trained  
• any **preprocessing tricks** you employed  
• the **evaluation tricks** that made you grin  

> 🚀 Once you drop that content, I can turn it into a smooth, science-documentary-style story with a dash of wit — think of it as giving your methodology a friendly tour guide who knows how to throw in a pun or two.

Let me know the specifics, and we’ll get the narrative rolling! 🎬💡

💬 What detail would *you* share first to bring your method to life?
